# Osteoarthritis X-Ray Classification Deep Learning Project
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to create a set of deep learning models trained to assign Kellgren-Lawrence scores to x-ray images of knees. The data came from the [Digital Knee X-ray
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommyngx/digital-knee-xray) dataset on Kaggle. This served as the final project in DTSA 5511: Introduction to Deep Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder.
